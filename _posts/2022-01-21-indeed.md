<h3>Abstract</h3>

Deep learning technology has made a significant improvement in image recognition performance. Unlike single-labeled  training and inference, multi-labeled classification tasks hardly  characterize individual label in the training of deep neural networks due to co-occurrence of the labels. Training data contains  few samples of separated single label and the networks learn  diverse compositions of labels from the data. Contextual bias  caused by the co-occurrence of labels disturbs multi-label clas-  sification. We propose Identical and Disparate Feature Decomposition (INDeeD) from multi-label data that explicitly learn the  characteristics of individual label. By training a backbone net-  work combined with Identical and Disparate blocks on the in-  stance pairs of partially common and contrastable labels, the net-  work is generalized to decompose and learn individual label fea-  tures. Proposed INDeeD scheme can be simply incorporated in  any type of networks. We use ML-MNIST, ML-CIFAR-10, VOC-2007, and MS-COCO datasets to evaluate the performance of INDeeD showing improved mAP over baseline.
